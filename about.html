				<p id="About">
				Hello, welcome to my About page!

				THE IDEA.
				It started out as an idea that I had a long time ago but only crept up when I thought of something relevant to it. Never did I think I would be able to do pursue the idea much less build a website. :o But thanks to Circuits General Assembly, I was able to give the idea life and give it a try. 
				THE CONCEPT.
				Like the dress up game used in the movie "Clueless", the concept is to be able to virtually mix and match different outfits without putting a thing on. Using clothing you own as well as clothing online before you even purchase it. Your own virtual doll with your body dimensions and look. You can dress him/her in clothing from your own closet or clothing from one of our many Partnering Brands; Uniqlo, Express, Old Navy and many more. 
				ABOUT ME.
			 	I've always had an interest in fashion. I did not pursue it in school or as a career unfortunately for fear that I wouldn't be good enough and wouldn't be able to make a living with it. But it shows in how I dress myself and dress even my family members in my day to day life.
			 	PROS
			 	It gets bothersome trying on and changing out of so much clothing sometimes. 
			 	Now you don't have to, with virtual dress up; so Dress Yourself!
